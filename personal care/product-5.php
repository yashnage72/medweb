                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Sirona’s Menstrual Cup is the most modern, economical and leak-free way of experiencing complete period comfort. It is a reusable, silicone cup that collects rather than absorbing your menstrual flow and is worn internally. It is ideal for those who care for their own health (cups don’t disrupt your natural pH) and (disposal of sanitary products create toxic waste). Cups are made of high-quality medical-grade silicone that is widely applied in products such as infant nipples, catheters etc (it is toxin free, odourless and hypoallergenic). Thanks to its design, it is an ideal menstrual aid for swimming, all other kinds of sports, travelling and common daily chores! With Sirona’s Menstrual Cup you would always be prepared to take on your periods!<br>

                    How to put in Menstrual Cup?<br>
                    
                    Follow these steps to put in the menstrual cup:<br>
                    
                    1. First and foremost, wash your hands properly.<br>
                    2. Then, fold the menstrual cup in C-fold or punch down fold ( whichever is more convenient for you).<br>
                    3. Hold the folded sides firmly in between your thumb and forefinger such that the curved edge is facing away from your palm<br>
                    4. In a comfortable position (while standing or squatting), gently insert the cup into your vagina. Ensure that your vaginal muscles are relaxed. It should be placed at a few inches below the cervix.<br>
                    5. Rotate the cup once it is in your vagina so that it springs open and creates an airtight seal which would prevent leaks.</p>
